# Python Games 

Welcome to the Python Games Repository! This repository contains fun and interactive Python games that are simple to play and easy to understand. Currently, it features two exciting games:

1. **Snake, Water, and Gun**
2. **Number Guessing Game**
3. **Stopwatch**

## Game 1: Snake, Water, and Gun

### Overview
This is a simple command-line version of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game with a twist! In this game, you can choose from **Snake**, **Water**, or **Gun** to battle against the computer. Each choice has a specific outcome when compared with the computer's random selection.

### How to Play
- **Input**: You can choose:
  - `s` for Snake
  - `w` for Water
  - `g` for Gun
- The computer will randomly choose one of these options.

## Game 2: Number Guessing Game

### Overview
This is a simple number-guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and you have to guess it. With each guess, the game gives you a hint whether to guess higher or lower. The game ends when you guess the correct number.

### How to Play
- The computer will select a random number between 1 and 100.
- You need to guess the number by entering your guess.
- After each guess, the game will provide feedback:
  - "Higher number please" if your guess is too low.
  - "Lower number please" if your guess is too high.
- The game continues until you guess the correct number, at which point the program will display the number of attempts it took you to win.
