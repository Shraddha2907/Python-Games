## Game 2: Number Guessing Game

### Overview
This is a simple number-guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and you have to guess it. With each guess, the game gives you a hint whether to guess higher or lower. The game ends when you guess the correct number.

### How to Play
- The computer will select a random number between 1 and 100.
- You need to guess the number by entering your guess.
- After each guess, the game will provide feedback:
  - "Higher number please" if your guess is too low.
  - "Lower number please" if your guess is too high.
- The game continues until you guess the correct number, at which point the program will display the number of attempts it took you to win.
